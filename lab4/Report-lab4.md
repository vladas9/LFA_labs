## Introduction

Regular expressions represent a formalized method for pattern definition and string manipulation, serving as a fundamental concept in formal language theory. This laboratory work focuses on implementing a system that generates valid strings based on regular expression patterns, effectively reversing the traditional regex matching process.

## Theory

Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and manipulation in strings. They consist of three fundamental components:

1. **Literals**: Exact characters that match themselves (e.g., `a`, `b`, `2`)
2. **Metacharacters**: Special symbols with contextual meaning (e.g., `*`, `+`, `|`, `?`)
3. **Quantifiers**: Symbols that specify repetition patterns (e.g., `{n}`, `{m,n}`, `^+`)

The semantics of regular expressions follow specific rules:
- `a|b` means either 'a' or 'b'
- `a*` means 'a' repeated zero or more times
- `a+` means 'a' repeated one or more times
- `a?` means 'a' appears zero or one time
- `a{n}` means 'a' appears exactly n times
- `a^+` represents a custom notation for one or more repetitions of 'a'

In this laboratory work, we implement a dynamic regex interpreter that processes these patterns to generate valid strings while tracking each transformation step.

## Objectives

1. **Primary Goal**: Develop a regular expression string generator that processes input patterns into valid output strings
2. **Understanding**: Gain practical insight into regular expression syntax and component behavior
3. **Algorithmic Approach**: Implement a systematic parsing method for handling different regex operators
4. **Transformation Visibility**: Create a mechanism to track and display the step-by-step processing (bonus)

## Implementation Description

The implementation follows a modular approach with clearly defined processing stages:

### 1. Core Class Structure

The `RegexGenerator` class serves as the central component, handling all regex transformations:

```python
class RegexGenerator:
    def __init__(self, max_repeat=5):
        # Maximum number of repetitions for *, +, and custom operators
        self.max_repeat = max_repeat
        
        # Ordered dictionary to track transformation steps
        self.processing_steps = OrderedDict()
        
        # Step counter for process tracking
        self.step_counter = 1
```

### 2. Processing Pipeline

The generation process follows four sequential stages, each addressing specific regex components:

#### Step 1: Exponent Handling

This stage converts custom exponent notation to standard quantifiers:

```python
def _process_exponents(self, pattern):
    # Convert a^+ notation to a{1,max}
    before = pattern
    pattern = re.sub(r'(\w)\^\+', 
                    lambda m: f"{m.group(1)}{{1,{self.max_repeat}}}", 
                    pattern)
    
    # Convert a^n notation to a{n}
    pattern = re.sub(r'(\w)\^(\d+)', 
                    lambda m: f"{m.group(1)}{{{m.group(2)}}}", 
                    pattern)
    
    # Record transformation
    self._record_step(before, pattern, "Converted exponent notation to standard quantifiers")
    return pattern
```

#### Step 2: Alternation Resolution

This stage processes alternations by randomly selecting one option:

```python
def _process_alternations(self, pattern):
    before = pattern
    
    # Process nested alternations from innermost to outermost
    while '(' in pattern:
        pattern = re.sub(r'\(([^()]+)\)', 
                        lambda m: random.choice(m.group(1).split('|')), 
                        pattern, 
                        count=1)
    
    # Record transformation
    self._record_step(before, pattern, "Resolved alternations by random selection")
    return pattern
```

#### Step 3: Quantifier Expansion

This stage expands all quantifiers into concrete repetitions:

```python
def _process_quantifiers(self, pattern):
    before = pattern
    
    # Handle * (zero or more)
    pattern = re.sub(r'(\w)\*', 
                    lambda m: m.group(1) * random.randint(0, self.max_repeat), 
                    pattern)
    
    # Handle + (one or more)
    pattern = re.sub(r'(\w)\+', 
                    lambda m: m.group(1) * random.randint(1, self.max_repeat), 
                    pattern)
    
    # Handle ? (zero or one)
    pattern = re.sub(r'(\w)\?', 
                    lambda m: m.group(1) * random.randint(0, 1), 
                    pattern)
    
    # Handle {n} (exact count)
    pattern = re.sub(r'(\w)\{(\d+)\}', 
                    lambda m: m.group(1) * int(m.group(2)), 
                    pattern)
    
    # Handle {m,n} (range)
    pattern = re.sub(r'(\w)\{(\d+),(\d+)\}', 
                    lambda m: m.group(1) * random.randint(int(m.group(2)), int(m.group(3))), 
                    pattern)
    
    # Record transformation
    self._record_step(before, pattern, "Applied quantifiers to generate repetitions")
    return pattern
```

#### Step 4: Cleanup

This final stage removes any residual syntax markers:

```python
def _cleanup(self, pattern):
    before = pattern
    
    # Remove concatenation markers and other residual syntax
    pattern = pattern.replace('Â·', '')
    
    # Record transformation
    self._record_step(before, pattern, "Cleaned up residual syntax markers")
    return pattern
```

### 3. Process Visualization

For debugging and educational purposes, the implementation includes step visualization:

```python
def print_steps(self):
    """Display all transformation steps in sequence"""
    print("\nProcessing Steps:")
    for step, data in self.processing_steps.items():
        print(f"{step}. {data['explanation']}")
        print(f"   Before: {data['before']}")
        print(f"   After:  {data['after']}")
        print()
```

## Results and Testing

   After:  11023333336

Final Result: 11023333336
```

### Example 3: Complex Pattern `a(b|c){2,4}d+(e|f)*`

```

## Conclusion

This laboratory work successfully demonstrates the practical implementation of a regular expression generator, effectively reversing the traditional pattern matching process. Through this implementation, several key insights were gained:

1. **Algorithmic Understanding**: The step-by-step processing approach highlights the inherent complexity of regular expression parsing and the importance of proper operator precedence.

2. **Randomization and Determinism**: By incorporating controlled randomization in the alternation selection and quantifier expansion, the generator produces varied but valid outputs that conform to the input pattern.

3. **Parsing Challenges**: The implementation revealed several edge cases, particularly in handling nested structures and resolving operator conflicts, which required careful algorithm design.

4. **Practical Applications**: Beyond its educational value, such a generator has practical applications in test data generation, fuzzing for security testing, and automated content creation.

5. **Connection to Theory**: The laboratory work reinforces the connection between theoretical formal language concepts and practical programming applications.

Future enhancements could include supporting more advanced regex features like character classes, backreferences, and lookahead/lookbehind assertions. Additionally, optimizing the generator for performance with very large patterns could be explored.

The implementation successfully meets all outlined objectives and provides a solid foundation for understanding the relationship between regular expressions and the strings they represent.
